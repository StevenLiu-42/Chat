# Assignment1
Those who have completed part0 and sent a PR (Pull Request) will receive a **tutorial** about the backend in the comments section of the Pull Request. This tutorial will guide you in detail on setting up the environment, installing necessary tools, and completing each required API. For this part, it's essential for you to be well-acquainted with the course content (Code-Your-Stage-Backend-Workshop) and follow the instructions to finish your backend assignment.

## How to hand-in?
Create a branch named `assignment_part_1` and push to your repo. And then just send a PR to your branch (develop_[your_name]) in upstream. Note that if your want to modify your assignment, **just push the same branch to your repo**. Because the pull request is still there, github will automatically track your commit.

## After handing-in
Once you complete the assignment, you will receive the **frontend codebase**. This will allow you to see the frontend presentation results after verifying the completion of the backend. The frontend task is advanced and optional. However, it's straightforward since there are no bugs to overcome, and there's no code for you to write. It's recommended to give it a try.
