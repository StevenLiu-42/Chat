## Advanced Assignment
(This is advanced and not a required assignment.) After completing the backend assignment, you should have the ability to create APIs. You've also had experience connecting to APIs remotely through the frontend. Now let's try connecting our own frontend to our own backend!
  
1. First, run both the frontend and backend services simultaneously. They should each occupy different ports.
2. Mimic the method used in the remote assignments by using the useSWRFetch function. The API URL will look something like http://localhost:[port_name]/getData.
  
This time, no bugs have been left for you to fix! Just go ahead and complete it, turning it into a fully functional service. After finishing, just send a PR. The branch name is `assignment_advanced`.
